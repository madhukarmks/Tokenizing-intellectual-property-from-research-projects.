## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize intellectual property management by leveraging blockchain to ensure transparency, security, and equitable monetization. This project aims to:

- Provide an immutable record of intellectual property ownership.
- Allow researchers to tokenize their creations into unique digital assets.
- Foster a decentralized ecosystem for collaboration and innovation.

## Key Features
1. **IP Tokenization:** Researchers can tokenize their intellectual property to represent it on the blockchain.
2. **Ownership Records:** The contract maintains a secure and transparent record of IP ownership.
3. **Decentralized Access:** Anyone can query IP details, ensuring openness and accountability.
4. **Security:** All data is stored securely using blockchain technology, ensuring data integrity.
5. **Event Emissions:** The contract emits events to notify the community about new IP tokenizations.
